# Simple Guestbook

Simple guestbook built with Lumen and VueJs,
inspired by [Laracasts guestbook](https://github.com/laracasts/Laravel-and-Vue)
but a little bit different, and better.

<del>You can find a demo hosted on my personal site's guestbook [Guestbook](http://claudioludovico.panetta.it/guestbook)</del>
